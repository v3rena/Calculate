## Gitflow priniciples in a nutshell
* Maintain two branches: `master` and `dev`
* Create temporary throw-away feature branches
* The `master` branch is most stable branch
* Maintain a `dev` branch where feature branch patches are integrated
* Tag only stable versions in the master branch

## Commits

A properly formed Git commit subject line should always be able to complete the following sentence:

If applied, this commit will `your subject line here`

For example:

* If applied, this commit will `refactor subsystem X for readability`
* If applied, this commit will `update getting started documentation`
* If applied, this commit will `remove deprecated methods`
* If applied, this commit will `release version 1.0.0`
* If applied, this commit will `merge pull request #123 from user/branch`
